# Emotion-Detection-in-Text
This Jupyter Notebook implements a machine learning pipeline to detect emotions from textual data. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text cleaning and feature engineering, followed by logistic regression for emotion classification.
Key Steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Imports necessary libraries like pandas, NumPy, seaborn, neattext, scikit-learn.
Loads the emotion dataset (emotion_dataset_raw.csv).
Explores the distribution of emotions using value counts and visualizations (Seaborn countplot).
Data Cleaning:

Utilizes neattext's remove_userhandles function to eliminate user mentions (e.g., "@username").
Applies remove_stopwords function to remove common, non-meaningful words from the text.
Feature Engineering and Labels:

Identifies features: Cleaned text (Clean_Text).
Defines labels: Emotion categories (Emotion).
Data Splitting:

Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split (70% for training, 30% for testing).
Sets a random state (42) for reproducibility.
Model Building with Pipeline:

Employs Pipeline from scikit-learn to streamline model creation.
Constructs a pipeline with two stages:
CountVectorizer: Converts text data into numerical features (term frequencies).
LogisticRegression: Classifies text into different emotion categories.
Training and Evaluation:

Trains the pipeline on the training data (x_train, y_train).
Evaluates performance on the testing data (x_test, y_test).
Calculates accuracy (pipe_lr.score) and prints the result.
Prediction and Probability:

Demonstrates making a prediction for a new text sample (ex1).
Shows how to obtain prediction probabilities using pipe_lr.predict_proba.
Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:

Generates a confusion matrix to visualize model performance on different emotion categories.
Creates a classification report that provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each emotion class.
Requirements for Posting on GitHub:

Create a GitHub Repository:

Sign up for a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
Create a new repository and give it a descriptive name (e.g., emotion-detection-text).
Initialize the repository with a README file using git init and git add README.md.
Structure Your Notebook and Data:

Place your Jupyter Notebook code in a .ipynb file (e.g., emotion_detection.ipynb).
Add your emotion dataset (emotion_dataset_raw.csv) to the repository.
Consider including a requirements.txt file to list dependencies if you use external libraries beyond the standard ones.
Commit and Push to GitHub:

Use Git commands like git add, git commit -m "Initial commit", and git push to commit your code and data to the remote GitHub repository.
Additional Considerations:

Version Control: Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and data over time. It's highly recommended for any development project.
Documentation: Include comments in your code to explain what different parts are doing. Consider adding a README file with a project overview, installation instructions, and usage examples.
Readability and Style: Follow consistent coding style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) to improve readability and maintainability.
Testing: Consider incorporating unit tests to ensure your code works as expected
